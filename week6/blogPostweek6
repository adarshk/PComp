The idea of what constitutes a physical interface has definitely changed over the last few weeks. I feel that I have become more observant of any interaction that I use everyday with familiar objects. The idea that an interface does not have to be explained rather it has to explain itself is what I think is important when working on projects. I used to think about solving problems when building and making things with user interaction not having such a high priority. I always thought that I could explain my project using instruction sheets that I could give out. However that has changed recently when I feel that I need to give the user control over the project and I become merely an observer. By flipping the roles, I feel that I become more aware of what I am trying to build also helps me understand and learn better. In a way I feel that my initial ideas have also been strengthened when I thought about how the communication varies between a tangible and an intangible objects and how much liveliness we can infuse into certain objects only by introducting small changes that play with emotion.
